Loops:
	Loops in java help us execute a piece of code
	again and and again. There are mainly 4 types of loops
	for loop while loop do while loop and enhanced for loop.
why we should learn about loop?
	Because loops help us write cleaner
	and scalable code. for example if you have to test 
	 password field on a webpage you can create different
	 variation of data in an excel sheet then you pick
	 all the values one by one and test the field.
Syntax for loops:
	for loop
	for(starting point; ending point; step size){
	code that we want repeat
	}
