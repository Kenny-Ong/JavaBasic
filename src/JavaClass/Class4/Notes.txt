Type Casting(primitive data types):
	Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
	For example we can covert a short to byte a long to float etc.
	There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual
Implicit/widening/automatic Type casting:
	When java converts the data type automatically for us. It only happens when we assign
	a smaller data type to larger data type, because there is no data loss in this conversion
Explicit/narrowing/Manual Type casting:
	When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called
	Explicit/narrowing/Manual. It doesn't happen automatically we have to do it explicitly 
	Manually.
Why we should learn type casting
	When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the from others to save time and we might also
	need to convert the data type to make our code compatible with their code.
What is the syntax for type casting?
	we use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for example
	if we want to convert a long to a int this is how we can do it.
	long var1=250;
		in var2=(int)var1; // its Manually/Explicit/Narrow
		double var3=var2 //Implicit/widening/automatic

If else conditions
	If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
Why we should learn about if else?
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our programs need to make a lot of decisions
	IF (the given username and password matches) 
	{
		(go to home page);
	{
	ELSE 
		(give user a warning);
	}
	if (video freezing) {
	
What is the syntax for If else conditions?
	boolean isHungry=true;
	
	if (isHungry)
	{
		system.outprintln("hungry");
	}
